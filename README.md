# 💻 Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) in C++ Repository

This repository contains organized code examples and exercises focusing on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)** concepts in **C++**.

---

## 💡 Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)** is a core paradigm in C++ that structures programs around **objects**—real-world entities that encapsulate both **data** and **behavior**. It allows for more modular, reusable, and maintainable code.

OOP in C++ is built on four fundamental principles:

* **Encapsulation:** Bundling of data and methods that operate on that data, while restricting direct access to internal details.
* **Abstraction:** Hiding the complex internal workings of classes and exposing only the necessary parts of functionality.
* **Inheritance:** Enabling one class to derive properties and behaviors from another, promoting code reuse and hierarchy.
* **Polymorphism:** Allowing functions and objects to take on multiple forms, enhancing flexibility and dynamic behavior in programs.

## 📁 Foundational C++ Topics

The following folders contain relevant files and questions covering **core, procedural C++ topics**:

* **Arrays**
* **Character Array**
* **Conditionals**
* **Functions**
* **Loops**

---

## 📘 C++ OOP Topics

This repository also includes detailed examples and practice files for the following Object-Oriented Programming topics:

* **Classes and Objects** — Basic implementation and usage.
* **Constructors and Destructors** — Automatic initialization and cleanup.
* **Encapsulation and Data Hiding** — Using access specifiers (private, public, protected).
* **Inheritance** — Demonstrations of single, multiple, and multilevel inheritance.
* **Polymorphism** — Examples of compile-time (function/operator overloading) and runtime (virtual functions) polymorphism.
* **Abstraction** — Abstract classes and interfaces.
* **Operator Overloading** — Customizing operators for user-defined types.
* **Templates** — Generic programming with class and function templates.
* **Exception Handling** — Safe error handling using try, catch, and throw blocks.

## ⚙️ Compilation & Execution

You can compile and run any file individually using the following command:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -Wall filename.cpp -o output_name
./output_name
```

Example:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 inheritance/single_inheritance.cpp -o single_inheritance
./single_inheritance
```

## 🧠 Learning Focus

Each example in this repository focuses on:

* Understanding both **procedural** and **object-oriented** programming in C++.
* Implementing **C++ features** efficiently and correctly.
* Writing **clean, readable, and maintainable** code.
* Building a strong foundation for **advanced C++ programming** and **real-world applications**.

---

## 📝 Additional Notes

* Follow consistent naming conventions.
* Each folder may contain its own mini `README.md` for concept explanations.
* Use `#pragma once` or include guards in header files.
* Avoid `using namespace std;` in headers for better practice.
