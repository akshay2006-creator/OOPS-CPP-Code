## 💡 What is OOP?

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a core paradigm in C++ that structures programs around **objects**—real-world entities that encapsulate both **data** and **behavior**. It allows for more modular, reusable, and maintainable code.

OOP is built on four fundamental pillars:

  * **🔒 Encapsulation:** Bundling data and methods together, restricting direct access to internal details.
  * **👻 Abstraction:** Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary functionality.
  * **🧬 Inheritance:** Enabling new classes to inherit properties and behaviors from existing classes, promoting code reuse.
  * **✨ Polymorphism:** Allowing objects and functions to take on multiple forms, enhancing flexibility.

-----

## 📁 Foundational C++ Topics

Before diving into objects, it's smart to have a strong grip on the basics. These folders cover **core, procedural C++ topics**:

  * **Arrays**
  * **Character Array**
  * **Conditionals** (if/else, switch)
  * **Functions**
  * **Loops** (for, while, do-while)

-----

## 📘 C++ OOP Topics

Here's where the magic happens\! This repository includes detailed examples for the following OOP topics:

  * **Classes and Objects** — The basic blueprints and instances.
  * **Constructors and Destructors** — Automatic initialization and cleanup.
  * **Encapsulation and Data Hiding** — Using `private`, `public`, and `protected`.
  * **Inheritance** — Single, multiple, and multilevel examples.
  * **Polymorphism** — Compile-time (overloading) and runtime (virtual functions).
  * **Abstraction** — Abstract classes and pure virtual functions.
  * **Operator Overloading** — Making operators like `+` or `==` work with your classes.
  * **Templates** — Creating generic classes and functions.
  * **Exception Handling** — Writing robust code with `try`, `catch`, and `throw`.

## 🚀 Getting Started: How to Compile & Run

You can compile and run any `.cpp` file individually.

1.  **Open your terminal** and navigate to the folder containing the file.
2.  **Compile** using `g++`:

<!-- end list -->

```bash
# Compiles the file and creates an executable named "output_name"
g++ -std=c++17 -Wall filename.cpp -o output_name
```

3.  **Run** the compiled program:

<!-- end list -->

```bash
./output_name
```

**Example:**

```bash
# Navigate into the inheritance folder
cd inheritance/

# Compile the specific file
g++ -std=c++17 single_inheritance.cpp -o single_inheritance

# Run it!
./single_inheritance
```
